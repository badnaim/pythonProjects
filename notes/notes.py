# widgets are the building blocks of tkinter
# Widgets: text, buttons, checkboxes, menus, frames etc

# Tkinter has 2 sets of widgets

# tk widgets were the original ones
# ttk widgets  were added later on(those are much more modern)

# Tkinter has inbuilt variables that are designed to work with widgets
# They are automatically updated by widget and they update a widget
# Although they still store basic data like string, integers and booleans

# There are 3 major kinds of button 
# Button, Checkbuttonm, Radiobutton 
# But to use them properly you need tkinter variables
